# Texas-Housing-Prices
I am cleaning American Community Survey data and Zillow Home Value Index data from 2006 to 2019. Use RegionName as the key variable to merge datasets and perform exploratory data analysis. Set up for future spatial difference-in-difference analysis.

This data will be the foundation for two different projects. The first is looking at the effect a cultural district has on housing prices in Texas's metropolitan regions. The second is a deeper dive into the impact cultural districts have on Austin, Texas, and Austin's changing cultural identity.

The next step is to hand-code a dummy variable containing a cultural district for each metropolitan region.
