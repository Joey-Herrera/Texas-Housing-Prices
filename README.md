# Texas-Housing-Prices
I am cleaning American Community Survey (ACS) data obtained via IPUMS and Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) data from 2006 to 2019. I use RegionName as the key variable to merge both datasets and perform exploratory data analysis. This repository lays the foundation for future spatial difference-in-difference analysis.

This data will be the base for two different projects. The first is looking at the effect a cultural district has on housing prices in Texas's metropolitan regions. The second is a deeper dive into the impact cultural districts have on Austin, Texas, and Austin's changing cultural identity.

The next step is to hand-code a dummy variable containing a cultural district for each metropolitan region.
